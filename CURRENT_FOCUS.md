# ORAC STT Service - Project Plan

## Current Status (2025-07-23)

### âœ… Completed Today (2025-07-22)
**Phase 1: Core Architecture & Setup** - COMPLETE
- Python package structure with organized modules
- Configuration management supporting TOML files and environment variables
- Logging framework with JSON and standard formats
- Main application entry point with FastAPI
- Health check endpoints (/health, /health/live, /health/ready)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint with basic metrics
- Deployment scripts for Orin Nano (SSH to orin3)

**Phase 2: Audio Processing Pipeline** - 60% COMPLETE
- WAV file validation (16kHz, 16-bit mono) âœ…
- Audio duration validation (max 15s) âœ…
- Audio buffer management for streaming âœ…
- FLAC support hook (stubbed for future) âœ…
- Whisper model loader with caching âœ…
- GPU/CPU fallback handling âœ…
- Basic audio processor with format support âœ…

### ðŸš¨ Issues Discovered
1. **Port Conflict**: Another ORAC container was using port 8000
2. **Container Creation**: Our container was created but couldn't start due to port conflict
3. **Deployment Status**: Application built successfully but needs clean deployment

### ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Tomorrow's Tasks

**Morning Priority:**
1. **Deploy Application Successfully**
   - Port 8000 is now free (all containers stopped)
   - Run deployment script to get basic server running
   - Verify health and metrics endpoints work

2. **Debug Startup Issues**
   - Check container logs for any import or dependency errors
   - Verify Python path configuration
   - Test GPU access from container

3. **Complete Minimal Working Version**
   - Get FastAPI server responding to health checks
   - Ensure metrics are being collected
   - Document any missing dependencies

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Implementation Tasks

**Phase 2 Completion (Audio Processing):**
- Create model inference wrapper
- Build audio-to-text pipeline
- Extract confidence scores from Whisper
- Implement language detection

**Phase 3 (API Implementation):**
- Implement /stt/v1/stream endpoint
- Add 202 Accepted response pattern
- Create streaming response handler
- Add request timeout (20s)
- Validate headers (X-Model-Name, Authorization)

## Tomorrow's Action Plan

```bash
# 1. Deploy fresh container
cd scripts
./deploy_and_test.sh

# 2. Monitor logs
ssh orin3 "docker logs -f orac-stt"

# 3. Test endpoints
ssh orin3 "curl -v http://localhost:8000/health"
ssh orin3 "curl -v http://localhost:8000/metrics"

# 4. Check GPU access
ssh orin3 "docker exec orac-stt nvidia-smi"
```

## Dependencies Status

**Installed in Dockerfile:**
- Core: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, prometheus-client
- Config: toml, tomli

**Not Yet Installed (needed for Phase 2/3):**
- Audio: numpy, scipy, librosa, soundfile
- ML: torch, torchaudio, openai-whisper
- HTTP: httpx, tenacity

## Key Metrics to Track
- Startup time
- Memory usage at idle
- GPU detection success
- Endpoint response times

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with minimal dependencies
- Add audio/ML libraries incrementally
- Test each component in isolation
- Monitor resource usage on Orin Nano
